# Hi, I’m Rodolphe 👋

I write software so machines behave 🤖,  
and occasionally help humans do the same.

I’ve spent ~14 years building **embedded systems** that are expected to work *every time*, often in **safety-critical environments**. These days, I also enjoy **leading teams**, shaping clean architectures, and helping engineers do their best work—without surprises at 3 a.m. 🕒
